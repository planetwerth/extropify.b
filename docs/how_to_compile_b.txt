// B CODE: HOW TO MAKE IT COMPILE AND BE COOL

// Okay, listen up. You wanna make your B code work? Let’s do this. It’s not gonna make sense, but that’s the point. 

1. **Get the B Compiler:**
   - If you don’t have this, you’re done. Go find it. Don’t ask questions. If you can’t figure this out, the universe might just implode on you.
   
2. **Write the B Code:**
   - Open whatever app you use to type. Don’t care. It could be Notepad, it could be the terminal itself. It doesn’t matter. Just start typing stuff like:

   ```b
   // Some B code (does it work? who cares)
   function main() {
       print("I’m too smart for this. Watch this code do nothing.");
   }
